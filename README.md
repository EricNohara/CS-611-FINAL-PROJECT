# Notes from Q&A
- Teacher view of grading system
    - Teachers usually teach same course over different semesters
    - Content of class might change, but breakdown of assignments and exams remain the same
        - Every single semester/class has to be built from the beginning
        - Create template for classes?
        - Ability to copy from previous classes?
    - Gradescope does not automatically calculate grades
        - Compute weighted average of assignments
        - Maybe compute grade statistics to figure out curves?
    - Submit any type of file, based on assignment
    - Keep grade statistics
    - Ease of changing assignments/grades
    - Can assign different roles to different users
    - Similarity checker
